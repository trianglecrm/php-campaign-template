					The source of Dermarose&#39;s highly effective formula is the Swiss Rose, a resilient flower that thrives in the most adverse environmental conditions high in the Swiss Alps. The plant&#39;s unique stem cells never undergo an aging process and are equipped with regenerative powers that continuously self-renew.</p>
				<p>
					Stem cells obtained from the Swiss Rose have been shown to have the same protective and regenerative effect on human skin cells as they do on the plant&#39;s delicate flowers.</p>

					<b>Dermarose helps to fight the visual look of wrinkles and aging signs!</b></p>

					Our formula has shown to increase the vitality of epidermal stem cells by helping them to maintain their stem cell characteristics and protect these precious cells against environmental stress.</p>
				<p>
					By optimizing the potential of epidermal stem cells, Dermarose improves epidermal regeneration, reinforces the skin barrier and reduces signs of aging (wrinkles, redness, loss of radiance)</p>

					Swiss Rose Stem Cells have skin-boosting super powers thanks to this wonder ingredient&#39;s ability to renew and repair aging skin cells. It&#39;s a powerful, natural, self renewing agent that repairs the skin from environmental stress which causes skin&#39;s dryness, fine lines, and wrinkles. It helps combat and even reverse time&#39;s effect on your skin, because it stimulates the stem cells in your skin to produce collagen - a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm.</p>
