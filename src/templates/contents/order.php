                Terms and Conditions: You will receive a jar of Dermarose to try for 15 days! All you pay today is the shipping and handling fee via USPS First Class Mail. Delivery Confirmation and tracking information will be sent to the email address you provided within 24 working hours of placing your order. Try For 15 Days Before You Buy. If you are not satisfied with the results of Dermarose, call and cancel and your credit card information will be deleted from our system. You won&#39;t be charged anything besides the initial shipping and handling fee. However, if you absolutely love Dermarose, (which we expect you will!) and keep it past the 15 Day Trial period, your original form of payment will be charged $97.95 (regular retail price $143.00). 30 Day Money Back Guarantee: Once you decide to keep Dermarose beyond the 15 Day Trial and let us charge your credit card, you are still completely covered by a full 30 Day Money Back Guarantee. This means, if for whatever reason you are not happy with Dermarose, simply send back the jar within 30-days from the date of delivery, and get a full refund (minus shipping and handling charges) on your credit card. I consent to be called and/or texted on behalf of Adpire Contact via autodialer at the above number. My consent does not require purchase. Standard cellular rates will apply.
